Contributing
============

django-timepiece is an open-source project and we are excited to have
community contributions.

Submit an Issue
---------------

Issues are managed on Github. If you think you've found a bug then it's
helpful if you indicate the version of django-timepiece that you are using. If
you think your bug is JavaScript- or styling-related, then it is also helpful
to know which browser you are using.

Issues are also used to track new features. If you have a feature you would
like to see then you can submit a proposal ticket. We love it when others add
features and push them back up to us!

Get the Source
--------------

Feel free to fork django-timepiece and make your own changes. You can download
the full source by cloning the git repo::

    git clone https://github.com/caktus/django-timepiece.git

If you think that your changes could be helpful to others, please submit a
pull request to have it merged in. Here's a quick guide:

#. Fork the repo.

#. :doc:`Run the tests </testing>`. We only take pull requests with passing
   tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate.

#. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we
   need a test!

#. Make the test pass in all tox environments.

#. Follow `PEP8 style conventions <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
   Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.

#. We'll love you forever if you include documentation!

#. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to `caktus:develop`.

#. Now you're waiting on us. We'll typically review and comment on your pull
   request within 3 business days. We may suggest some changes, improvements,
   or alternatives to be used before pulling in the changeset.
